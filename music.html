        <h1>Music</h1>
        <div class="dog-text">
        <p> Music has always been a significant part of my life, whether it was doing music myself, 
            attending concerts, or planning concerts on campus.  
        </p>
        <p>I grew up singing, playing violin, and playing piano. I have a lot of memories performing places
            all over the state. I also was in a few musicals in high school. 
        </p>
        <p>One of my favorite things to do is go to concerts. From music festivals to small night clubs,
            I have always had the best time. 
        </p>
        <p>This past month I had the opportunity to plan my first concert on my own as Vice President
            of Events in Michigan Music Business Club. I learned a lot from this experience and had
            a lot of fun along the way.
