        <p>My name is Sydney Sella and I am a student at The University of Michigan studying Information Analysis.
            Though I love my classes and Michigan football, there are many things that
            I favorite outside of school.
        </p>
        <p>My favorite things that I will highlight in this blog are my dog, my family and friends, and music.
