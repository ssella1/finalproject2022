        <p> One of my favorite things is my dog Scout. We bought her from a friend of ours when I 
            was a freshman in High School. We liked the name Scout because of the book "To Kill
            A Mockingbird".  
        </p>
        <p>Scout has a very energetic personality and has been impossible to train. She can barely
            be walked on a leash. However, she is very loving and sweet so we don't mind.
